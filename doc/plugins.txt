Short notes to included plugins:

ace - TODO

aon - seems to be stable on 060, most of the time :)

asap - great ASAP player for Atari 8-bit musics. Comes in three versions:
asap.mxp (classic Atari), asap_cf.mxp (FireBee build) and asap_ara.mxp
(ARAnyM build). The reason for Aranym build is that zmagxsnd.prg has some bugs
in reporting current DMA pointer, so I used Timer A instead. Atari and CF
versions are 100% system friendly, not a single HW access.

dspmod - marked as 030 only, as I've seen it crash on CT60. It makes no
sense to use it on 060 anyway, there's XMP.

gt2 - on 060 it switches cache off (by default, you can change it) as some
modules with more channels crashed the player

mgt - 030 only, if I disable CT60 caches, then it's too slow ;) But don't worry,
XMP can play MGTs, too!

mp2 - no change against 1.x version. It can play some MP2s which the
original player can't. No Direct from Disk yet.

ntk - 030 only, not very stable, not very helpful :)

snd - 030 only, dirty, dirty, dirty.

xmp - the ultimate player for all kind of modules. It can play pretty much
everything. It's supposed to play MTMs and DMFs too but for some reason it
crashes, so be careful. But these are PC formats, anyway. It comes also in
three version, see above.

Generally speaking, don't expect too much from the fact mxPlay is a GEM
application. Most of the plugins rape OS vectors, timers, caches etc so maybe
except ASAP and XMP, you'll see quite strange side effects when clicking in
desktop.

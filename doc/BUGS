Known bugs:

- problems with drag&drop/va-start/argv. No, this is NOT an mxPlay bug.  The
  only desktop which handles these issues correctly is Teradesk (since I
  flooded the author with ton of bugreports ;-).  Thing is on the second
  place and the worst one from this point of view is Jinnee.

- icon redraw errors under TOS. For some strange reason TOS instead 
  of selecting some icon inverts the current bitmap. This happens 
  only if you click on some icon. So for example, press '*' and 
  the playlist icon will be (de)activated with no problem. But If you 
  click on this icon, you will see a strange rectangle around it...

- flashing scrolling line - this isn't a bug, it's just slowness of 
  AES and/or CPU you use.. little hint: try to locate panel as on 
  bottom as possible :)

- you can't drag the top border of Module Info and Playlist to resize the
  dialog. It caused redraw errors and I was lazy to invetigate :)

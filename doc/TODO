Roadmap for the next releases:

1.x
===

- fix bugs described in BUGS file

- rework Plugin Info dialog

- implement setup dialog with various on/off options:
	- asking for saving in default.m3u
	- using real module names instead of filenames
	- auto playlist opening on startup
	- auto playlist opening on file add
	- delete playlist when add file
	- auto playing file when adding to empty playlist
	- repeat for song only or playlist

- popups in playlist window

- some general aproach of creating filenames, e.g. if no ID3 tag, use 
  %no - %author - %songname.ext scheme

- support for ICE, Atomik, etc packers

- d2d for mp2/mp3

- repositioning the playlist window entries with mouse

- slider for current music playback (position in song)

- untopable window dialogs (this will require rewrite some parts of 
  CFLib)


2.x
===

- visualization API
- ?

Any ideas?

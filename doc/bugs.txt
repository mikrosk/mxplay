Known bugs:

- problems with drag&drop/va-start/argv like long filenames, filenames with
  blanks, quotes etc.  mxPlay has one of the best implementations of these
  protocols, i.e.  it's most likely a bug in your desktop.  The only desktop
  which handles these issues correctly is Teradesk (since I flooded the
  author with ton of bugreports ;-). Thing is on the second place and the
  worst one from this point of view is Jinnee.

- icon redraw errors under TOS. For some strange reason TOS instead 
  of selecting some icon inverts the current bitmap. This happens 
  only if you click on some icon. So for example, press '*' and 
  the playlist icon will be (de)activated with no problem. But If you 
  click on this icon, you will see a strange rectangle around it...

- flashing scrolling line - this isn't a bug, it's just slowness of 
  AES and/or CPU you use.. little hint: try to locate panel as on 
  bottom as possible :)

- sound repeat in feed-based players (ASAP, XMP, MPG) when doing something
  in your desktop (file selector, pushing mouse buttons for longer time,
  ...) - unfortunately, mxPlay is hooked on the AES loop, i.e. if AES events
  stop coming, so does the music data.

- you can't drag the top border of Module Info and Playlist to resize the
  dialog. It caused redraw errors and I was lazy to invetigate :)

I made some (significant) changes to CFLib, i.e. there's no more 
option to set window dialog title using underscored string as aes 
object #1 - it's useless in my eyes and it complicates custom dialog 
resizing A LOT. And at last, I implemented new function - 
create_custom_wdial with definable flags for wind_create.

This is mxPlay 2.0, an audio media player for Atari 
TT030/Falcon030/Falcon060 range of computers.

Read about spreading conditions in doc/COPYING.

Read about plugins included in doc/PLUGINS.

Read about application's functions in doc/html/using.htm.

As there was exactly zero interest from other programmers about coding
plugins, I'm not going to bother with documentation this time, in case you'd
like to code / fix a plugin, drop me a line, I'll give you some hints.

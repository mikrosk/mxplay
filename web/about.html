			I have to apologize for the poor quality of this homepage. We've got promise from our friend (BAKY, author of <a href = "http://noise.atari.org"
target = "_blank">Noise homepage</a>) he will make some nice &amp simple html page for us. However, the page he sent me is... too simple ;) And he went away for maybe a week or more. So I decided to make some my (lame) one but with the possibility at least to show more than one sub-page :) I hope in the near future the quality of webdesign will increase.. (if you can make html/php and you've got some spare time, don't hesistate to contact us)

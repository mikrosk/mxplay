			<dt><b>Where can I find the latest binary of mxPlay?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">The latest one will be always downloadable from
			<a href = "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=150035" target = "_blank">sourceforge.net</a>. However,
			there could be some dropout e.g. due to maintainance, then use <a href = "http://mxplay.atari.sk/files/mxplay-latest.zip">atari.sk mirror</a>. If you're
			looking for "dead-branch" (custom sliders, resizers, ...) try <a href = "http://mxplay.atari.sk/files/mxplay-dead-branch.zip">this link (sources + binaries for 020+FPU)</a>
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>Why should I download mxPlay binary and plugins separately?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Since sourceforge.net doesn't allow publishing non-free software on their web pages, cvs repositories etc. Most
			of replay routines is done by "dead" people, there's a little chance I will get agreement for GPL-like license for all routines I find...
			and it would be really strange to have some plugins here, some at sourceforge.net...
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How it's with licensing and source codes for plugins?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">
			mxPlay is free software published under General Public License. However, it uses plugin based approach so you can
			guess if you are forced to release your plugins under GPL, too. No, you aren't. mxPlay is standalone project, the same
			goes for each plugin. mxPlay doesn't depend to any of its plugins so these plugins are not part of mxPlay so you can choose
			own licensing model (good example is Firefox browser - it's free and under GPL but it uses non-free plugins, too - Macromedia Flash for one).
			Anyway, I recommend you to use GPL - it's fair and you can be sure nobody will spread your routine under his name nor will lost
			if you decide to drop your development...
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>Who are maintainers of mxPlay?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Currently, there's only one maintainer - Miro Kropacek, me :) Look into <a href = "contact.html">contacts</a> if you've got some specific question about development or anything else related to mxPlay.</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How can I subscribe to mxPlay mailing list?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Go to the <a href = "http://sf.net/projects/mxplay" target = "_blank">project site</a>, click
			 on "Mail" and then "Subsribe/Unsubsribe/Preferences" label. Then follow instructions. After this step
			you will be able to send and receive mail to/from mailing list.
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How can I download sources from CVS and what it is good for?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Go to the <a href = "http://sf.net/projects/mxplay" target = "_blank">project site</a>, click
                         on "CVS" and then you will see basic information about CVS (anonymous, i.e. read only) access for mxPlay project. If
                        you're wondering what is CVS for: it's a tool which provides many nice features for developers working on  bigger projects.
                        It stores older versions, track changes, gives information when/who/how modified any file etc. And at last but not least it gives you
                        the opportunity to try the latest (not yet released) version. If you would like to try it, let's start with <a href = "http://sourceforge.net/docs/B01/#cvs_client" target = "_blank">some cvs client</a>.
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How to report bug?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Go to the <a href = "http://sf.net/projects/mxplay" target = "_blank">project site</a>, click on
			"Bugs" and then "Submit New". You will see some fields where you can submit your bug report. Please, always describe as much information as
			possible. Remember, don't report bugs already reported! To verify list of all bugs click "browse"
			and then set each category to "Any" - after submit you will see list of all bugs with their status.
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>I've found some bug in sources - how to make a patch?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">You've got two choices: 1. Send me the patched source 2. Send me the patch as output from "diff -u source_file > destination.patch".
			If I will see you're pretty active you will get write-access to CVS tree.. This procedure applies also for plugins - it's clear the best way is
			to send me the new one since it will be published at this homepage only.
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How can I contribute to mxPlay development?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">There's plenty of choices. You can:
			<ul>
				<li>download mxPlay sources and add new features/bugfixes (in 99% cases it's normal C source)</li>
				<li>download plugin sources and add new features/bugfixes (mostly assembler stuff)</li>
				<li>make new plugins for unknown/unpublished replay routines</li>
				<li>make new skins</li>
				<li>spellcheck documentation</li>
				<li>send new ideas about future development, report bugs, or ... just send a mail with "I like mxPlay" :)</li>
			</ul>
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How can I request for a new feature?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Go to the <a href = "http://sf.net/projects/mxplay" target = "_blank">project site</a>, click on
			"Feature Requests" and then "Submit New". You will see some fields where you can submit your request.
			There's same rule as with bug reporting - at first always look to the existing list of requested features.
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>How can I submit/fix documentation?</b></dt>
			<dd><p align = "justify">Go to the <a href = "http://sf.net/projects/mxplay" target = "_blank">project site</a>, click on
			"Docs" and then "Submit new documentation". You will see some fields where you can submit your file. Please note you should post
			HTML documents only! (even if the label "Upload Text File" says something other :)
			</p></dd>
			
			<dt><b>I'm bored with all this stuff I just want to send you mail about bug / idea / bugfixed source!</b></dt>
            <dd><p align = "justify">Of course, you can still use "classic" mail reporting. Those options make maintainer's life easier (I don't have to re-check all mails everytime
            to verify I didn't forget some bug etc) but are not the only way I'm open to communicate :)
            </p></dd>

This is the 'dead branch' of mxPlay development. It's custom dialog 
based one, with own sliders and resizers. I drop this way since using 
AES sliders are much faster and much easier to handle... however, if 
there's someone brave who want to resurrect this version/approach, 
you'll welcomed. Try it on own risk. The best functionality was 
observed under XaAES.

<h3><p><a name = "1">1. Introduction</a></p></h3>
<p align = "justify">
Phew... so it really happend... if you're reading this text it means 
our little child called mxPlay is finally released.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Everything started with the one post on our local Atari list for 
Czech and Slovak Atari fans, where one guy has complained he isn't 
able to use great MegaPlayer under CT60 and that is bad there's no 
decent player for so many formats... Some guy on dhs.nu came with the 
idea to make plugins to FalcAMP, but it seems FalcAMP development is 
quite slow (I asked Frost about release date but he's hunting bugs so 
no release date is know yet :( ) and even no plugin API is known...
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Final 'ass-kick' was Xi's reply to my comment "Did you see the new 
GemAce and GemMod? They looks pretty nice!" in style "Yeah, that's 
nice, but hell, I don't want to have nice player for mods, nice 
player for ace songs and another nice one for mp3s.. I want one, good 
looking player with the playlist!". Oh yes, here it really started.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
After some discussion we came to the point "That's damn easy to make 
it! We have many free replay routines for various formats, we'll make 
some lame gem interface to it, hmm, maybe playlist will be a little 
bit tricky, but this could be done in 1-2 weeks!". So, 3 months 
passed very fast and here you are, mxPlay player with playlist, 
skins, plugins, open code and the coolest user features from the 
plenty of other players ;)
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Maybe you're wondering what the hell we did make on this for about 3 
months. Firstly, I'm democoder. I didn't know nearly anything about 
GEM. So getting touch with this kind of programming was a new 
experience for me. Secondly, every day we come with new ideas what 
should we add, my TODO list was (and still is) full of things to 
implement...
</p>

<h3><p><a name = "3">3. Windows</a></p></h3>

</p>

activated even on untopped panel.
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.1 Play</p></h5>

<p align = "justify">
Self-explaining.
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.3 Pause</p></h5>

If you're at the end of playlist and the 'Repeat' button was 
activated (see bellow) as next file will be taken the first one.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
If 'Random' button was activated, next song will be choosen randomly.
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.7 Previous Song</p></h5>
<p align = "justify">

will be played even in random mode, no random selection as done in 
Aniplayer!
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.8 Playtime</p></h5>
<p align = "justify">

la Winamp or XMMS.

we're on the last entry in the playlist.
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.10 Random</p></h5>

</p>

Mute the playing. Please note this function is not working very well 
:)
</p>

<h5><p>3.1.12 Volume Slider</p></h5>

system status so you can try to play with volume in some CPX and you 
will see the effect :)
</p>

Open/close playlist.
</p>

<p align = "justify">
Add file(s) to the playlist. Please note your fileselector has to 
support Selectric and/or MagiC fileselector protocol to select more

example.
</p>

<h5><p>3.2.2 Add Directory</p></h5>
<p align = "justify">
Add director(y|ies) to the playlist. It's fully recursive operation 
so, yes, you can take your music partition and open it in mxPlay! If

such directory, clear "filename" field and press RETURN.
</p>

<h5><p>3.2.3 Select All</p></h5>

</p>

think ;)
</p>

<h4><p>3.4 Plugin Info</p></h4>
<p align = "justify">
Similar to Module Info but you're allowed even enter some values. It 
could be simple on/off flag or numerical/text parameter. If there are 
up and down arrows you can scroll with them (sorry no resize at this 
time...)

<h3><p><a name = "6">6. Thanks</a></p></h3>
<p align = "justify">
At first I would like to thank to all people who decided to publish 
their source codes. Without them there's no mxPlay. So for 
others - please, support free software, release your source code - it 
helps all of us. Very good example is zView, really good work, Zorro!
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Next I have to thank Xi, my never-tired-for-another-bugreport friend 
;), without your usefull hints about application architecture and 
without your massive support I doubt I finish mxPlay in this look and 
functionality.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Also thanks to people on MiNT list, they helped me sometimes when I 
was in total dark :)
</p>
<p align = "justify">
And at last but not least I have to thank YOU, Atari fan, you're 
still using Atari computers!
</p>

<h3><p><a name = "7">7. Contact</a></p></h3>

you can make skins. If you can't make GEM dialogs, you can test 
mxPlay, spell-check documentation, think about new features, ... help 
is always welcomed.</p>

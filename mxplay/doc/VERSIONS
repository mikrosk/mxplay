There are different versions of mxPlay:

mxPlayM[F].app: FreeMiNT memory protection compatible version. It 
                uses MiNT kernel's timers for the time measuring.

mxPlay[F].app: standard version, runnable under FreeMiNT, too but you 
               have to switch off memory protection.

"F" versions: compiled against -m68020-60 (libc, cflib, gemlib, 
              mxPlay)... size difference is minimal, maybe you can 
              gain some speed against normal versions...

Normal versions: mxPlay is compiled against -m68030 (no FPU), libc, 
                 gemlib, cflib is normal 68000 code.
